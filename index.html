About the project    
</h3>
RemoteFlags is a microhosting service, created to host small, frequently updated strings, which can be read from any app, eliminating the need for frequent patches or updates
    <br>
RemoteFlags can hold data such as the latest version of your app or game, and whether or not an update is critical, you may also store up-to-the-minute data such as active users, using our API, which is still in development.
    <br>
For example, remoteflags.com/Flags/12032003.html holds a sample string. Or find it by the web address http://remoteflags.com/flags/12032003.html
